# Java-Sax-DOM
OOD 
Using the Java SAX parser (event-based parser), create a Document Object Model (DOM/directed graph/tree) representation of the data contained in an XML document. The resulting DOM is to contain all the data that is provided in the XML document and should work for any XML document structure. The parser is to be a static method on a class that is appropriately named. The parser is to throw exceptions if problems are encountered.
